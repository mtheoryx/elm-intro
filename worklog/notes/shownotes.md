# What the hell is elm?

It's a functional programming language, a compiler, and a framework
for developing JavaScript applications.

Typed
Functional
Language

PURE functional language - Everything is immutable

Functional concepts are hard to grasp, so Elm was created to take advantage
of them, but not force you to fully understand the background (monads, etc).

Who is the "User"?

Front-end developers. How can they get started and get all the power ?!

Gradual learning.

You don't need to force-feed functional concepts, you can just build web
applications, and learn on the way.

ELM is WELL documented. Tutorials, example applications, etc.

**Friendly error messages!!** The compiler knows what you're trying to do,
and what you should do to be safe.
